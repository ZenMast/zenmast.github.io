| **Man of Steel (2013)**            | This movie has more plotholes than Swiss cheese. Picture and graphics are beautiful tho.                                                                                                                                                         | 5/10⭐ |
| **Stranger Things**                | There is hardly any other comparably dark and serious TV show about 80s out right now. Starting from 4th season it got much lighter and lost its mood, still good.                                                                               | 8/10⭐ |
| **Knives Out (2019)**              | Decent detective in Agatha Kristie's style.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 7/10⭐ |
| **The Days of the Turbins (1976)** | Very interesting Soviet movie about intelligentsia and White Guards in the days of communist revolution in Russian empire and end of WW1 in 1918-1919, in Kyiv where a group of relatives and friends officers must take a stance in the face of oncoming bolsheviks. | 7/10⭐ |
| **From the Life of a Chief of the Criminal Police (1983)** | A compelling detective/drama taking places during Soviet times. | 7/10⭐ |
| **The Pokrovsky Gate (1982)** | Interesting, funny, poetic, light-hearted comedy set in 50s Moscow. With splashes of occasional French. | 8/10⭐ |
