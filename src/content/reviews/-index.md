| **Stranger Things**                                        | There is hardly any other comparably dark and serious TV show about 80s out right now. Starting from 4th season it got much lighter and lost its mood, still good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 8/10⭐  |
| **Knives Out (2019)**                                      | Decent detective in Agatha Kristie's style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 7/10⭐  |

| **From the Life of a Chief of the Criminal Police (1983)** | A compelling detective/drama taking places during Soviet times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 7/10⭐  |
| **The Pokrovsky Gate (1982)**                              | Interesting, funny, poetic, light-hearted comedy set in 50s Moscow. With splashes of occasional French.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 10/10⭐ |
| **Only Old Men Are Going to Battle(1974)**                 | Rightfully one of the most best Soviet movies about WW2. Human relationships, different backgrounds of Soviet fighter pilots (Ukrainian commandor, Uzbek pilot, Russian lieutenant...), and the music. Movie uses real WW2 footage. At the movie premiere real pilot veterans were applauding commenting "Exactly how it was..." . Movie received a lot of critique from Soviet censors and was initially banned, and it only saw the light of the movie theaters mostly thanks to veteran soldiers (some of them very high in ranks) who were campaigning for release of the movie. | 10/10⭐ |
| **The Green Knight (2021)**                                | I enjoyed very much the dark fantasy atmosphere, it was very well done. Very immersive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 7/10⭐  |
| **The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004)**                 | Brilliant finish to the best 3 seasons of SpongeBob ran by S.Hillenburg (R.I.P). High quality animation, children jokes mixed with adult humor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 8/10⭐  |
