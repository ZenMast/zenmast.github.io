| **Man of Steel (2013)** | This movie has more plotholes than Swiss cheese. Picture and graphics are beautiful tho.                                                                           | 5/10⭐ |
| **Stranger Things**     | There is hardly any other comparably dark and serious TV show about 80s out right now. Starting from 4th season it got much lighter and lost its mood, still good. | 8/10⭐ |
